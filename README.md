## Preface 
Java burst onto the scene and gained instant celbrity status 
the promise of java was that it would become the univeersal glue that connects users with info wherever it comes from. Ideed, java is in a unique position to fulfill this promise. It is extremely solidly engineered language that has gained wide acceptance. its builtin security and safety features are reassuring both to the users and programmers such as connectivity, concurrency and networking 

Java comes with a large programming library, or Application Programming Interface. Java API now spans such diverse areas as user interface construction, database management, internationalization, security and XML processing 

They should make good starting point for your own code and you are wiling, even eager to learn about all the advanced features with the explosive growth of the java class library




## Table of Content 

[Part1 Java Setup](lec1.md) an overiew of the capabilities of java set it apart from other languguages, guide you through compiling and running typical programs


[Part2 Fundamental Programming Structure in Java, Data Types, Variables, and Strings ](lec2.md) variables,loops and simple functions, this is smooth sailing 


[Part3 Control Flow](lec3.md) in the mainstream of programming pratices, encapsulation, foundational building blocks, classes and methods. Sound OOP design, marvelous javadoc tools that formats code comments as a set of hyperlinked web pages. 


[Part4 Object Oriented Programming Encapsulation](lec4.md) in the mainstream of programming pratices, encapsulation, foundational building blocks, classes and methods. Sound OOP design, marvelous javadoc tools that formats code comments as a set of hyperlinked web pages. 


[Part5 Object Oriented Programming Inheritance](lec5.md) take an existing class and modify it according to your needs. 


[Part6 Object Oriented Programming Interface](lec6.md) mastering interfaces allow you to have the full access to the power of completely oop approach to programming. Lambda expression, a concise way for expressing a block of code that can be executed at a later point 


[Part7 Exception Handling](lec7.md) robust mechanism to deal with the fact that give you an efficent way of separating the normal processing code from the error handling 

[Part8 Generic Programming](lec8.md) strong typing and remove unsightly and unsafe casts, how to deal with the complexities that arise from the need to stay compatible with older versions 


[Part9 Collection Frameworks](lec9.md) collect multiple objects and retrieve them thta is best suited for your circumstances, instead of just tossing the elements into an array, take advantage of the standard collections that are prebuilt for your use





## Disclaimer 
this comprehensive coverage takes a holistic approach to cover most of language features in a highly in-depth way 
features like lambda and streams are discussed in great detail 
. Errors and inaccuracies are inevitable. 
I have taken care in the preparation of this note, but make no expresssed or implied warranty of any kind and assume no reponsibility for errors or omission. No laibility is assumed for incidental or consequential damages in connection with or arising out of the use of the info contained herein 

Writing it is always a monumental effort, especially with the continous change in java technology, making it a reality takes many dedicated times and valuable assistance but manage to stay behind the scenes
